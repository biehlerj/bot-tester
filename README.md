# bot-tester

First application built using OpenFaaS. The contents of the repo contains the code for a bot to automatically tag issues as reviews depending on how they are written using a sentimental analysis machine learning program. All the work done here was done during a workshop at Cisco DevNet Create following a guide on GitHub which can be found at: https://github.com/openfaas/workshop.

Thanks to Alex Ellis, Eric Stoekl, and co. for this awesome tutorial.
